First of all, thanks for taking the time to look this over.

Swipe left from the first screen to see more details about a store; the store you swipe on will show up.
I hadn't done any robust testing, but hopefully the experience is polished enough.
I would typically leave a little more in terms of comments, in places to clarify intent and such for others who may continue my work.
The landscape version of the details page hasn't been refined.
Also, the code could use a little more cleaning up.
