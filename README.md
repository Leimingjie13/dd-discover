First of all, thanks for taking the time to look this over.

Swipe left from the first screen to see more details about a store; the store you swipe on will show up.
I hadn't done any robust testing, but hopefully the experience is polished enough.
I would typically leave a little more in terms of comments, in places to clarify intent and such for others who may continue my work.
Also, (obviously) the code could use a little more cleaning up.
